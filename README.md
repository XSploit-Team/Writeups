# Writeups

CTF Writeups by the Z3R0D4Y Team. The writeups are arranged by year, then by CTF Name and then by challenge. There might be some missing writeups, either because we didn't have time to write them or the challenge was so easy that it wouldn't be necessary.

## Why make writeups?

Some might think that it's a waste of time to do writeups. In some cases this can be true for very easy challenges, but for more advanced challenges, it can be good to do a writeup. Let's say that you are sitting at doing a CTF challenge, and you feel like you have dealed with something similar, then you could look through the writeups, find the one that seems similar and hopefully get some new ideas for a solution.
